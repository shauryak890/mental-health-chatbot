            <h3>What is mental health?</h3>
            <p>Mental health encompasses our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act, and determines how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p>
            
            <h3>Mental health in university students</h3>
            <p>University students face unique challenges that can impact their mental health, including academic pressure, financial stress, social adjustments, and career uncertainty. Research shows that nearly 40% of college students experience a significant mental health issue, yet many don't seek help due to stigma or lack of awareness about available resources.</p>
            
            <h3>The importance of early intervention</h3>
            <p>Addressing mental health concerns early is crucial. Early intervention can prevent issues from worsening, reduce the duration of illness, and improve outcomes. Recognizing changes in thoughts, feelings, or behaviors and seeking support when needed are key steps toward maintaining good mental health.</p>
